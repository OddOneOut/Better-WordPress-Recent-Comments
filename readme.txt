This plugin displays recent comment lists at assigned locations, with comprehensive support for widgets.

== Description ==

This plugin displays recent comment lists at assigned locations. It does not add any significant load to your website. The comment list is updated on the fly when a visitor adds a comment or when you moderate one. No additional queries are needed for end-users.

A recent comment list, in my opinion, can help stimulate discussion and exploration of your blog tremendously. Now for the past few months I have been using a plugin called Get Recent Comments; though this plugin is configurable and indeed popular, the code is somehow messy and no support for custom post type is found. The worst thing is Get Recent Comment doesn't seem to be updated anymore, so I decide to write another recent comment plugin which is more lightweight and makes use of some nice features provided by WordPress 3.0.

**Some Features**

* Has the options to show comment only, trackback only, or show both (separately or all together)
* Possibility to add different comment lists with different settings on one page
* You can sort comment lists descendingly or ascendingly
* Supports custom post type
* Supports Gravatar
* Supports smiley
* Widget-ready
* Template functions ready
* Generate Zero SQL query for end-users
* Possibility to trim comment to a specific number of words
* Possibility to split long words into smaller chunks
* WordPress Multi-site compatible (not tested with WPMU)
* And more...
